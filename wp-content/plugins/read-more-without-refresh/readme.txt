Read more/Read less Modal Javascript Plugin

== Description ==

This plugin hides the text that you will choose to hide, leaving the other selected one visible to the search engines, maximizing your SEO, but hidden from public in order to provide better user experience.<br>
<br>Once you press <strong>"Read more" button</strong>, it will <strong>expand</strong>. <br>
You can also hide it again by pressing the same button, which is now converted to <strong>"Read less"</strong>.<br><br>
It works via a shortcode and can be placed everywhere!<br>Usage: <strong>[read more="Read more" less="Read less"] Your long text [/read]</strong><br><br>

== Installation ==

All you have to do is upload the plugin within your Wordpress Plugins menu and activate it. 
Then, you can add the shortcode everywhere you want (pages, posts, widgets etc): 

<strong>[read more="Read more" less="Read less"] Your hidden text here [/read]</strong> 

You can, of course, change "Read more" and "Read less" to whatever you want.
